# RestaurantOrderTracker
This app is meant to inform users of the status of their orders at takeaways. In this app you must cater
for multiple takeaways. This app is used by two distinct types of people - staff and customers. The
app should offer the following functionality.
1. Staff should be able to add an order. The order doesnâ€™t need to record what items were ordered,
but they must record who the order is for, which staff member created the order, and what time
the order was created. St/aff should also be able to see the average rating their orders have
achieved.
2. Staff should be able to mark an order as either pending (which is the default state), ready
(meaning that the order if waiting for the customer to pick it up) or collected (meaning that
it has already been collected by the customer).
3. When a customer logs in, they should be able to see the status of all their orders, including
which restaurant it is from. Customers should be able to rate the service received on each order
with a simple thumbs up or thumbs down.
